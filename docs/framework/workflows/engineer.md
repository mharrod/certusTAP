**Actors**

* *Security Engineer* – Authenticates, queries, and reviews assurance context.  
* *Assurance Chat Agent* – Verifies provenance and orchestrates retrieval/reasoning.  
* *TrustCentre* – Source of signed manifests, ledger entries, and evidence.  

**Actions**

1. *Engineer Authenticates*  
    - Logs in via **OIDC / enterprise SSO** (with MFA) to the Assurance Chat portal.  
    - Chat session is bound to the engineer’s **identity and key pair** — all prompts/responses are **signed** and **timestamped**.  

2. *Session Context Retrieval*  
    - Agent auto-loads the current **Assurance Manifest**, latest **scan results** and **AI reasoning outputs**, and **Ledger entries** for the latest run.  
    - Displays a contextual greeting:  
      “You’re reviewing *System X* (build 2025.10.10). **78** findings detected, **4** waivers pending review.”  

3. *Trust Validation*  
    - Before any reasoning, the agent verifies **OCI signatures** and **Rekor** entries.  
    - The engineer is **never** reasoning on untrusted or unsigned data.  

**Desired Outcomes**

| Outcome | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Verified Session Context** | All artifacts loaded for the session are signed, timestamped, and current. |
| **Identity-Bound Interactions** | Each query and response is bound to the engineer’s identity and key. |
| **Provenance-First Workflow** | Reasoning only occurs on cryptographically verified inputs. |
| **Frictionless Kickoff** | The engineer starts with an actionable, trustworthy summary. |

#### 2) Exploratory Querying & Analysis

??? info "Assurance Chat – Exploration Workflow (Simplified Sequence)"
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant ENG as Security_Engineer
        participant AGENT as Assurance_Chat_Agent
        participant RET as Retriever
        participant LED as Ledger
        autonumber

        %% Step 1 - Exploration
        ENG->>AGENT: Ask for high-severity issues in auth service
        AGENT->>RET: Query retriever index (BM25 + embeddings)
        AGENT->>LED: Get recent ledger changes
        AGENT-->>ENG: Return summarized findings

        %% Step 2 - Code Context
        ENG->>AGENT: Show code and fix for hardcoded secret
        AGENT->>RET: Fetch code snippet and related policy rule
        AGENT-->>ENG: Provide summary and remediation advice

        %% Step 3 - Cross-System Reasoning
        ENG->>AGENT: Check if issue appeared before
        AGENT->>LED: Search historical records by fingerprint
        AGENT-->>ENG: Reply with occurrence history and waiver reason
    ```



**Actors**

* *Security Engineer* – Explores, filters, and inspects findings.  
* *Assurance Chat Agent* – Queries **Retriever index (BM25 + Embeddings)**, **Audit Ledger**, and **AI Reasoning Memory**.  

**Actions**

1. *Natural Language Exploration*  
    - Engineer asks: “Show me all **high-severity** vulnerabilities in the authentication microservice since the last patch.”  
    - Agent queries retrievers, ledger changes since last run, and prior AI recommendations.  
    - Response example:  
      `3 findings detected:`  
      `• CVE-2024-5832 in auth.py:142 – Token reuse vulnerability.`  
      `• Hardcoded secret in jwt_manager.py – found via OpenGrep.`  
      `• Dependency outdated (Flask 2.0.3 < 3.0.0) – known exploit path.`  

2. *Code Context Summarization*  
    - Engineer: “Show the code context around the hardcoded secret and a recommended fix.”  
    - Agent retrieves function-level snippet from **RAG memory** and merges it with the **policy rule** on secret rotation; emits a **signed** contextual explanation.  

3. *Cross-System Reasoning*  
    - Engineer: “Did this issue appear in previous builds?”  
    - Agent searches historical ledger, matches fingerprints, and replies:  
      “First seen **2025.09.12**, waived once, reintroduced by commit `6d2f…`. Waiver reason: *legacy configuration handling*.”  

**Desired Outcomes**

| Outcome | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Conversational Discovery** | Natural-language queries reliably retrieve signed findings and context. |
| **Context-Rich Summaries** | Explanations include code, policy, and prior decisions. |
| **History-Aware Insights** | Fingerprint matching reveals regressions and waiver lineage. |
| **Signed Analytical Responses** | Explanations are emitted as verifiable artifacts. |

        Agent->>Agent: Retrieve related code and dependency graph
        Agent->>Agent: Build attack chain hypothesis in three stages
        Agent-->>Engineer: Run scenario
        Agent->>Agent: Sign and store threat scenario artifact

        %% Step 2 - Dynamic Querying
        Engineer->>Agent: Run analysis assuming pull request two eight four merged
        Agent->>Agent: Collect code changes and update retriever data
        Agent->>Agent: Recalculate and compare new risk level
        Agent-->>Engineer: Provide updated scenario with reduced risk summary
    ```



**Actors**

* *Security Engineer* – Requests simulations and what-if analysis.  
* *Assurance Chat Agent* – Performs fusion retrieval and produces signed **Threat Scenario** artifacts.  

**Actions**

1. *Exploitability Simulation*  
    - Engineer: “Reason through the exploitability if JWT reuse and a hardcoded secret are chained.”  
    - Agent retrieves related code and dependency graphs, builds an **attack-chain hypothesis**:  
      `1) Secret exfil from jwt_manager.py → 2) Token forgery (CWE-345) → 3) Bypass via /auth/refresh.`  
      `Risk: Critical | EPSS 0.93 | CVSSv3 9.1`  
    - Output is signed as a **Threat Scenario Artifact**.  

2. *Dynamic Querying*  
    - Engineer: “Re-run assuming PR #284 is merged.”  
    - Agent fetches diffs, updates embeddings, re-evaluates, and reports **risk reduction** deltas.  

**Desired Outcomes**

| Outcome | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Actionable Attack Paths** | Simulations describe credible, evidence-linked exploit chains. |
| **What-If Reruns** | Proposed fixes can be tested virtually against current evidence. |
| **Quantified Risk** | Scenarios include EPSS/CVSS and confidence indicators. |
| **Signed Scenarios** | Threat reasoning is preserved as immutable, replayable artifacts. |
