# Workflows

These workflows describe how actors within the assurance ecosystem interact to achieve specific objectives.  They capture **who** is involved, **what** each participant does, and **why** the interaction matters in maintaining trust and verifiable assurance.

These workflows serve three main purposes:

1. **Clarity and Communication**  
   They provide a clear narrative of how assurance workflows function end to end, ensuring both technical and non-technical stakeholders understand the process.

2. **Traceability and Accountability**  
   Each use case ties actions to identifiable actors, artifacts, and verification points — establishing the foundation for auditability and compliance.

3. **Design and Validation**  
   They help model the expected system behavior, define boundaries of responsibility, and validate that assurance mechanisms align with the defined trust model.

## Relationship to the Diagrams

Each use case in this section is paired with a **Mermaid sequence diagram** that visualizes the same scenario in an interaction format.   These diagrams depict the exchange of data, evidence, and verification messages between actors such as the **System Under Test**, **AI Reasoner**, **Human Reviewer**, and **TrustCentre**. 

The combination of narrative and visual flow enables readers to quickly understand both the intent and operational behavior of the assurance lifecycle — from data collection to signed, auditable outcomes.
