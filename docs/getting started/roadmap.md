# Roadmap

 This roadmap outlines the evolution of the Certus TAP PoC from foundational R&D to a fully autonomous, trust-centric ecosystem. Each phase strengthens the integration of AI reasoning, immutable evidence, and human oversight.  We are aiming to ensure that assurance processes remain transparent, verifiable, and explainable. By progressing through a structured Crawl ‚Üí Walk ‚Üí Run ‚Üí Fly approach, we hope to transform early experimental prototypes into production-grade, federated systems capable of sustaining continuous cross-organizational trust validation.

Here is a summary of each phase:
