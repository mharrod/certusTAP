# Pre-Alpha Notice

Certus TAP is currently in a pre-alpha phase of development.
At this stage, the framework is under active design and experimentation, but installation or deployment guidance is not yet available.

This page currently serves as a placeholder until formal documentation and setup instructions are released. As the project evolves, weâ€™ll update this page with new details, examples, and release notes.
